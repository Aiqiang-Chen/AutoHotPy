AutoHotKey replacement using Incerception driver

#FAQ

##Why? just... why?
AutoHotKey is great, but many games and programs don't work with it. And the ones that work have many counter-measures to stop it (because many script kiddies use it to cheat!).
I'm against cheating in games, but I'm also against discrimination. Many players have different kinds of disabilities, and they need helping tools to play.
I believe everyone deserves the right to choose which game, or program they want to use without limitations.

##How is it different?
AutoHotPy is a scripting tool, just like AutoHotKey, but it uses Interception library (https://github.com/oblitum/Interception).
The great thing is that Interception uses a very low level driver to capture keyboard and mouse events, which makes it perfect for games that have problems with AutoHotKey

##Why python?
Because when you write AutoHotPy scripts, you learn a real programming language that you can later use to write your own programs.




##TODO: I still have to write the documentation. I could do it now, but I want to write some kind of tutorial. Programming sounds scary for many people, so it's better to ease their pain by giving as many examples as possible.
The tool is already working. Just download Interception, install it, and then place the .dll next to the scripts to run it. but... the current example is not the easiest nor the right way to do a script. I was just testing some things. Really, just wait for the documentation.
